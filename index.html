            <p>My name is Cody, I was raised in Alaska and grew up in the food and beverage industry. I like to
                fishand hunt, however have yet to do either in Idaho. I moved to Idaho in 2017 and have been raising my
                son
                and our 3 dogs, while bouncing between various lines of work. Ive always loved technology, avid gamer,
                however i am a console guy (xbox), but i do know you PC players have it way easier on FPS games! </p>

            <p> I have worked in so many fields and industries , that combined with my photographic memory has enabled
                me to retain vasts amount of knowledge. I would love to design a POS system for retail businesses in the
                future. Just as much as I would love to design my son his own games. I am doing this to better the life
                of
                me and my son and im jumping with both feet. I am an avid BBQ guy, Ive got my own seasonings and sauces
                private labeled. And i can get my hands on some reindeer smoked meat sticks, family recipes from the
                business, so ill bring treats to class for everyone!</p>
